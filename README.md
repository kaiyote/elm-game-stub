# elm-game-stub
a stub implementation of a very pointless elm game

## to run
1. run `elm reactor` in the directory
2. open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
3. ???
4. Profit?

## what is this?
This is essentially a storage place for my ideas / learnings with elm/game-dev. Will this repo ever be useful to anyone? That depends. It'll probably never amount to a real game, but it should hopefully be a tolerable example of marginally good Elm code, and it'll at least be a reference point for me for some of the ideas I come across during my random development journey.

## todo
- [x] make a game of some sort
- [ ] make it show you your score
- [ ] add a help screen
- [ ] add graphics
- [ ] make some sort of win condition
- [ ] ???
- [ ] profit
